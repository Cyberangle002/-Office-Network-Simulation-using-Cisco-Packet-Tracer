# LAN + Subnetting Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a basic LAN setup with subnetting for network simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases the configuration of IP addresses, routers, switches, and devices within a network.

## Files in this repository:
- **LAN_Subnetting.pkt**: The Cisco Packet Tracer file for the network configuration.
- **README.md**: Information about the project.
- **network_diagram.pdf**: A visual diagram of the network setup.

## How to Use:
1. Open the **LAN_Subnetting.pkt** file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the network design and configurations.
3. Run simulation to test connectivity.

## Technologies Used:
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IP Subnetting
- Network Design
